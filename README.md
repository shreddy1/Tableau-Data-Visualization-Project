# Data Visualization Project on US Flight Delays and Cancellations in 2015

In this project, I created visualizations to reveal insights from US Flight Delays and Cancellation dataset. I created data visualizations that tell a story/highlight patterns in the dataset. 
The US Flight Delays and Cancellations data comes from a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays) dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. 

This project has been made using Tableau Desktop and I saved all my visualizations on Tableau Public and they can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/shreya.reddy3426#!/vizhome/FlightsDelays_15913766218850/FlightsCancelledbyState).
